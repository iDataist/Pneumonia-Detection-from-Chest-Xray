# Pneumonia_Detection_from_Chest_Xray

## Project Overview

I analyzed data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and trained a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. I generated a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy. I also prepared a document for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. As part of the submission preparation, I described the model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria.

The NIH Chest X-ray Dataset includes 112,000 chest x-rays acquired from 30,000 patients with clinical labels for each image that were extracted from their accompanying radiology reports.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- 2D medical imaging data analysis and preparation of a medical imaging model for regulatory approval
- Recommend appropriate imaging modalities for common clinical applications of 2D medical imaging
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on medical imaging data to inform model training and explain model performance
- Establish the appropriate ‘ground truth’ methodologies for training algorithms to label medical images
- Extract images from a DICOM dataset
- Train common CNN architectures to classify 2D medical images
- Translate outputs of medical imaging models for use by a clinician
- Plan necessary validations to prepare a medical imaging model for regulatory approval
